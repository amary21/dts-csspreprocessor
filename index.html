            <h4>Mini Bio</h4>
            <p>Jason Statham was born in Shirebrook, Derbyshire, to Eileen (Yates), a dancer, and Barry Statham, a
                street
                merchant and lounge singer. He was a Diver on the British National Diving Team and finished twelfth
                in
                the
                World Championships in 1992. He has also been a fashion model, black market salesman and finally of
                course,
                actor. He received the audition for his debut role as Bacon in Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels
                (1998)
                through French Connection, for whom he was modeling. They became a major investor in the film and
                introduced
                Jason to Guy Ritchie, who invited him to audition for a part in the film by challenging him to
                impersonate
                an illegal street vendor and convince him to purchase fake jewelry. Jason must have been doing
                something
                right because after the success of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998) he teamed up again
                with
                Guy
                Ritchie for Snatch (2000), with co-stars including Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio Del Toro.
                After
                Snatch (2000) came Turn It Up (2000) with US music star Ja Rule, followed by a supporting actor role
                in
                the
                sci-fi film Ghosts of Mars (2001), Jet Li's The One (2001) and another screen partnership with
                Vinnie
                Jones
                in Mean Machine (2001) under Guy Ritchie's and Matthew Vaughn's SKA Films. Finally in 2002 he was
                cast
                as
                the lead role of Frank Martin in The Transporter (2002). Jason was also in the summer 2003
                blockbuster
                remake of The Italian Job (1969), The Italian Job (2003), playing Handsome Rob.

                Throughout the 2000s, Statham became a star of juicy action B-films, most significantly Crank (2006)
                and
                Crank: High Voltage (2009), and also War (2007), opposite Jet Li, and The Bank Job (2008) and Death
                Race
                (2008), among others. In the 2010s, his reputation for cheeky and tough leading performances led to
                his
                casting as Lee Christmas in The Expendables (2010) and its sequels, the comedy Spy (2015), and as
                (apparently) reformed villain Deckard Shaw in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), Furious 7 (2015), The Fate of
                the
                Furious (2017), and Fast & Furious Presents: Hobbs & Shaw (2019). Apart from these blockbusters, he
                continued headlining B-films such as Homefront (2013).

                In 2017, he had his first child, a son with his partner, model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley.
